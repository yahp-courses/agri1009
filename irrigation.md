# Irrigation and Drainage

Supply of water to land and crops.

## Surface Irrigation

No mechanical pumps. Water source has to be higher, and gravity is what distributes the water. Need to have a steady supply/source of water year-round.

## Drip Irrigation

Localized. Drops of water are delivered on/near the plant by the root zone.

Very efficient.

## Sprinkler Irrigation

Distributed overhead by high-pressure sprinklers.

## Manual Irrigation

Manual labour. Labour Intensive.

Feasible for small areas.
