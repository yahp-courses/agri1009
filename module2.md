The agriculture sector suffers from high trade costs and low capacity to comply with modern food safety and quality standards.
The growing demand for high standard food products is thus mainly fulfilled by imports.  
The sector is also constrained by large and increasing pressures on natural resources and high vulnerability to climate change.

Agriculture can be an important source for economic growth and a key contributor to poverty reduction. But it must not compromise the natural capital and related ecosystem services. 

Inclusive and sustainable agricultural development can contribute in overcoming major socio-economic and environmental challenges in the region:
* Food and nutrition insecurity
* Obesity
* Youth unemployment
* Gender inequality
* Unsustainable use of natural resources 
* Climate change.

## The role of agriculture in the region

Historically, agriculture had a large role in Caribbean economies, with large sugar and banana plantations for export.

Today, Caribbean agriculture is more diversified, and makes up a smaller share of the economy. In several countries agriculture represents
less than 1 percent of GDP. In countries such as Haiti, Dominica, Guyana, and Grenada agriculture still contributes between 7 and 17 percent of 
GDP, but with a significantly larger share of employment.

# Overview of Vegetable and Food Crop Production in the Caribbean

There is focus on increasing food production and environmental conservation.

Crop production can be divided into five sub categories:

1. Fruits
2. Roots and tubers
3. Vegetables
4. Herbs and spices
5. Pulses and nuts

## Main crops grown by country in CARICOM

## Vegetables

A vegetable is a plant that is cultivated for an edible part such as the leaf, fruit, stem, or root.

### Types of vegetables

* Leafy Vegetable:
	* Lettuce 
	* Patchoi
	* Cabbage
	* Spinach

* Non-Leafy Vegetables:
	* Tomatoes
	* Sweet pepper
	* Pimento
	* Melongene

### Value of vegetables

Vegetables are a rich source of many essential micronutrients
* vitamins C and K
* foliate
* thiamin
* carotenes
* minerals
* dietary fiber

Most are also naturally low in fats and calories.

## Root Vegetables

Underground plant parts eaten by humans as food.

**true roots**:
* tabroots
* tuberous roots

**non-roots**:
* bulbs
* corms
* rhizomes
* tubers

### Nutritional importance of root crops

Starchy roots and tubers are an important source of carbohydrates. 

They are also a significant source of a number of compounds:
* saponins
* phenolic compounds
* glycoalkaloids
* phytic acids
* carotenoids
* ascorbic acid

Bioactivities:
* antioxidant
* immunomodulatory
* antimicrobial
* antidiabetic
* antiobesity
* hypocholesterolemic activities

## Herbs and Spices

A **herb** is any plant with leaves used for flavoring, food, medicine or perfume.

A **spice** is a seed, fruit, flower, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food.

### Nutritional importance of herbs and spices

Spices and herbs such as clove, rosemary, sage, oregano, and cinnamon are excellent sources of antioxidants with their high content of **phenolic** compounds.

Many herbs and spices, including oregano, thyme, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin, have antibacterial and antifungal properties that can help fight off disease.

Turmeric is famous for anti-inflammatory properites that provide relief to conditions like arthritis and metabolic syndrome. Also cinnamon, oregano, ginger, garlic, and cloves.
